```

Generator depends on a couple of libraries and applications, you need to connect
your platform to internet. If you are behind proxy server or firewall, please
refer Gradle documentation how to configure Gradle for network connections.
It will download some jar files from https://jcenter.bintray.com repository.
Then it convert source English resource files with translation result into
Japanese resources.

You can get the IDE's resources as `build/distribution/<name>.zip`
